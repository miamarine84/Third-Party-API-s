# Third-Party-API-s

Having not so much time as I like to complete this project im pretty happy to where it has come 
The only thing that i will finish up a bit late is the hour issue but I feel I made it harder on myself by doing essentially all the work through JS when it could of been much easier accomplished using both HTML and JS. But no excuses here please feel free to give me some tips on how the structure and readability of the code as well as how I could of gone by to either avoid or correct the pm issue thanks. Thanks for all your help. 

Note we we're told nothing about pictures on the README files so i did not put one even though i was told in the last homework check that we were suppose to put photos please if you can clear that up let me know thanks.
